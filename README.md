Looking forward to discussing this more. I used a style of writing tests that helps make them readable, even to non programmers. There are some improvemnts that would be made when working with a larger project. I also used some small waits to account for animation time on certain elements. This could be better by using a more dynamic solution, however animation length should be static and reliable so a small wait isn't a test breaker.
